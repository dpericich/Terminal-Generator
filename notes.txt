Sections
1) A TextArea with a few other inputs to determine commands vs. code
2) A display tab to show the output from the text inputs
3) [OPTIONAL] An advanced options tab to set themes, etc.

SCREEN 1 - INPUT
- what items are important here?
- need input for commands vs. code
- need input for light vs. dark theme (this will be basic, but can set more complex in the advanced tab)
- need input for actual text
  - will need to determine how to handle commands where the path is included on every line
  - do I just ask for the path to be included and regex it to remove it?


SCREEN 2 - OUTPUT
- React component container with styling based on theme selection
- All of the formatted input outputted as prescribed by the user (commands vs. code)


TESTING
- I will need to add jest to this to make sure that my cleaner / formatter code works
- There are a LOT of edge cases which will be considered for this code

LOGIC FOR FORMATTING
1) Command Line
- Need to understand the path
- Will need a Regex to separate the path from the code

2) Code Editor
- Will need to use the tag matching to get this to work
